I am a final year Ph.D student at MIT CSAIL in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu).
Some of my other close collaborators are
[Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
Before MIT, I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford,
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

Broadly speaking, my research lies at the intersection of systems
and cryptography. More specifically,
I am interested in building practical secure systems that
protect user data in large-scale, distributed web application systems.

I also enjoy collaborating and interacting
with industry executives to identify and address future 
needs in the security industry.
To bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. Top security companies and venture firms, like Highland Capital, Rapid7,
Cybereason, and Akamai, sponsor and support our program!
You can also find me hanging out with people from [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

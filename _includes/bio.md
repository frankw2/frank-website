I am currently a Ph.D student at MIT CSAIL in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu) where
my research interests lie at the intersection of systems,
cryptography, and web applications.
Some of my other close collaborators are
[Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
Before MIT, I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford University
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

The underlying philosophy of my research 
is that breaches and hacks have become inevitable, 
and the goal of secure 
systems should be to minimize information 
leakage when these breaches occur. 
However, systems with these protections should still be practical.
More broadly, I am interested in building practical secure systems,
especially in web application settings.
 
I also enjoy collaborating and interacting
with industry executives to identify and address future 
needs in the security industry.
To bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. You can also find me hanging out with people from [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

I am currently a Ph.D student at MIT CSAIL in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu), where
my research interests lie at the intersection of systems,
cryptography, and web applications.
Some of my other close collaborators are
[Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
Before MIT, I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford,
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

I am interested in building practical secure systems that
protect user data in large-scale, distributed web application systems.
Naturally, much of my research lies at the intersection of systems
and cryptography. Web services, such as Google, Facebook, and Dropbox,
are now an essential part of people's lives.
These services provide value by collecting
and analyzing user data. However,
once the user provides her information to the web service,
she \textit{loses control} over how the application uses or accesses
that data. For example, a user cannot control where the application
forwards her data. Even if the service \textit{wanted} to allow users to 
define access controls, it is unclear how these access controls
should be expressed and enforced. My research addresses these concerns.
 
I also enjoy collaborating and interacting
with industry executives to identify and address future 
needs in the security industry.
To bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. You can also find me hanging out with people from [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

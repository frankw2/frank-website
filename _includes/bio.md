I am currently a Ph.D student at MIT CSAIL in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu), where
my research interests lie at the intersection of systems,
cryptography, and web applications.
Some of my other close collaborators are
[Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
Before MIT, I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford,
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

Broadly speaking, my research lies at the intersection of systems
and cryptography. More specifically,
I am interested in building practical secure systems that
protect user data in large-scale, distributed web application systems.

I also enjoy collaborating and interacting
with industry executives to identify and address future 
needs in the security industry.
To bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. You can also find me hanging out with people from [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

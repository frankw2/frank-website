I am currently a Ph.D student at MIT CSAIL in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu).
I also work closely with [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford University
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

I am interested in building practical secure systems, 
focused on developing methods to use cryptography more efficiently and broadly.
My philosophy is that breaches and hacks have become inevitable, 
and the goal of my systems is to minimize information leakage when these
breaches occur. More broadly, my research interests lie at the 
intersection of systems, cryptography, and web applications.
 
I also enjoy collaborating and interacting
with industry executives to identify and address future 
needs in the security industry.
To bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. I am also a member of [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

I am currently a Ph.D student at MIT CSAIL in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu).
Some of my other close collaborators are
[Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
Before MIT, I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford University
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

My research focuses on building practical secure systems, primarily
developing methods to use cryptography more efficiently in web
application settings.
The underlying philosophy of my research 
is that breaches and hacks have become inevitable, 
and the goal should be to minimize information leakage when these
breaches occur. More broadly, my interests lie at the 
intersection of systems, cryptography, and web applications.
 
I also enjoy collaborating and interacting
with industry executives to identify and address future 
needs in the security industry.
To bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. You can also find me hanging out with people from [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

I am currently a security engineer at [dbt labs](https://www.getdbt.com/). In the past, I dabbled in venture capital at 
[Dell Technologies Capital](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/capital/ventures.htm) and academia.

I occasionally write about my thoughts on security in [my Substack newsletter, Frankly Speaking](https://franklyspeaking.substack.com).

This website is from an old life where I did academia for a living.
However, I still write about cool technical ideas and occasionally publish
papers. To keep up with what's happening in my life,
you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ffwang2).

I received my PhD from MIT focused on security and cryptography. I was in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu).
Some of my other close collaborators were
[Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
Before MIT, I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford,
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

During my PhD, to bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. I also hung out with people from [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

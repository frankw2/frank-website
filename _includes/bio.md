I am currently an investor at [Dell Technologies Capital](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/capital/ventures.htm)
focused on early-stage security and enterprise infrastructure investments.
If you are working on a cool startup in this space, please email me!

This website is from an old life where I did academia for a living.
However, I still write about cool technical ideas and occasionally publish
papers. To keep up with what's happening in my life,
you can also follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ffwang2) 
and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ffwang2).

I received my PhD from MIT where I was in the 
[PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) group, 
advised by [Nickolai Zeldovich](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/) 
and [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu).
Some of my other close collaborators are
[Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/),
[Shafi Goldwasser](http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/),
and [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/).
Before MIT, I received my B.S. in computer science from Stanford,
advised by [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/).

Broadly speaking, my research was at the intersection of systems
and cryptography. More specifically,
I was interested in building practical secure systems that
protect user data in large-scale, distributed web application systems.

During my PhD, to bridge the gap between academia and industry,
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com) with
[Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com), a summer program for early stage cybersecurity
startups. I also hung out with people from [Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc).

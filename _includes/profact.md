#### Professional Activities

I enjoy collaborating closely and interacting frequently
with industry.

To bridge the gap between industry and academia, 
I co-founded [Cybersecurity Factory](https://cybersecurityfactory.com)
with [Jean Yang](http://jeanyang.com/), a summer program for early
stage cybersecurity startups where I help startups with business
and product development. Through this program, I regularly interact
with security executives at both early-stage and established 
companies to identify and address future security needs. 

If you are an early stage enterprise startup, I would love to chat!

I am also a member of 
[Rough Draft Ventures](http://roughdraft.vc) that funds student founders.
In the past, I've also worked on the security teams at Google and Facebook.

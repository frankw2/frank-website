<p>Is this because the tools and clarity of measurement are inversely proportional to the stakes?  All academics are intimately familiar with the lust of publication but how many understand the ramifications of world economics from the core of their beings?</p>

## Data-Oriented Communcation Between Domain Experts and Technical Experts
<a name="structuredcomm"></a>

Journalism is rapidly moving towards data-driven articles and rely on gathering, cleaning, analyzing and reporting information that is valuable to the community.
Unfortunately, barring unicorn organizations such as <a href="">ProPublica</a> and the <a href="">NYTimes</a> that can afford a technical staff,
most journalism organizations and individuals have domain knowledge, access to data (e.g., a URL), and hypotheses (e.g., senate corruption), but lack access to the technical expertise to see these hypotheses through.
However, it is encouraging that more and more (though not enough) people are being trained in data analysis techniques and becoming civic minded at the same time.

These trends hint toward a symbiotic relationship around <i>data</i>.
The technical expert can contribute data scrapping, cleaning, and summarization expertise, 
but lacks the necessary background in the investigative domain to decide what data to gather, 
which data are important, and what analyses matter.
On the other hand, the journalist can provide domain experience to understand specialized information 
(e.g., 721.5 is the ICD9 code for Michotte's syndrome), intuition about what the data 
should ''look like'', where to start investigating, yet may need help performing the actual investigation.
Thus, a natural question is:

*Can we design tool to seamlessly connect journalists (domain experts) to technical experts where the lingua franca  is data?*

DESCRIBE A DUMB WALKTHROUGH.  In other words, where is the Slack for data journalism?

Certainly, there are a number of challenges to make this work:

* entity resolution and normalization
* IBM and I.B.M

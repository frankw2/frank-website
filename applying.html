  <h1>Ph.D. Applicants</h1>

<h2>My Goal</h2>

<p>My goal is to help my students practice and refine their abilities
  as researchers, and produce interesting research as a
  side-effect (albeit an important one).  </p>

<p>The following lists the abilities that I believe are particularly valuable:</p>

<p><table class='row'>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Critical &amp;<br/>logical thinking</td>
      <td>An important component of research is the ability to make logical arguments and back those arguments with evidence.  This will be your most important asset.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Technical knowledge</td>
      <td>
        Most computer scientists materialize their ideas through software systems 
        and use those systems to gather evidence.  Thus, the ability to quickly and effectively
        build the necessary systems will be a necessary component to your success.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Perseverance</td>
      <td>
        Unlike classes, where a few all nighters is sufficient to get by, the Ph.D.
        depends on making consistent, long term progress.  There will be many difficult times during
        a Ph.D. (e.g., paper rejections, creative blocks, or <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome/">imposter syndrome</a>) 
        that you will need the willingness to understand and overcome.
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Creativity</td>
      <td>
        Our goal when doing research is to push the boundaries of what has been explored. <br />
        There is an art to refining and <a href="https://vimeo.com/85040589">following your taste</a>
        when picking a specific problem to work on.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table></p>

<p>To help me identify applicants that will be a good match, it is 
  helpful for you to concretely demonstrate your <i>current</i> abilities. <br />
  The easiest way is to describe some past projects
  in terms of why they were interesting, your approach, the challenges and solutions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.arnab.org">Arnab Nandi</a>
  has a particularly 
  <a href="http://arnab.org/blog/so-i-suck-24-automating-card-games-using-opencv-and-python">good example</a>
  of a write up that is above and beyond what I would expect.</p>

<p>I don't expect applicants to be experts at everything, so it is important to be clear about
  your strengths and weaknesses.  For example,  I did not have 
  good writing technique when applying to graduate school and acknowledged it clearly
  in my application.</p>

<p>Finally, I will strive to work and generate ideas with you as a colleague.  So
  describe some cool research problems* that you would find awesome to work on!</p>

<h2>The Columbia Admissions Process</h2>

<p>Computer Science at Columbia uses a centralized admissions process.
Prospective Ph.D students apply to the computer science department
at large, and faculty members review the applications and nomiate
applicants for admission.  For this reason, it is helpful to 
<a href="mailto:eugenewu@mit.edu">let me know</a> you have applied
if you are interested in working with me.</p>

<p>All applications should be submitted through <a href="https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/recruit/">the electronic system</a>
by <strong>December 15</strong> for the Fall semester, and <strong>October 1</strong> for the Spring semester.</p>

<h2>Letters</h2>

<p>The best way to convince me you can do good research is to have someone vouch for
the good research you've done in the past. For this reason, the most effective letters are those 
from research supervisors that concretely describe your contributions to a specific project. </p>

<p>However, not every applicant has had the opportunity to perform research.  In this case,
letters that can describe your technical contributions, and the way you approach problems
are most useful.</p>

<p>I will actively avoid reading letters that solely describe your performance in a course.</p>

<p>Thus, my general order of preference of letter writers are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Research supervisor</li>
<li>Technical supervisor (e.g., your boss at a technical internship/job)</li>
<li>Project partners (e.g., a maintaner of an open source project)</li>
<li>Non-technical supervisor/Course instructor</li>
</ol>

<h2>Software Abilities</h2>

<p>Software development will be a large component of any systems computer science degree.  It is important
to demonstrate that you will be able to develop the systems necessary to conduct research experiments.
I am looking for students that have experience building systems -- in particular database and 
high performance systems.</p>

<p>If you currently have less software development experience, that is OK if you demonstrate that you can
and want to learn the necessary skillset.  The best way is to show a sequence of projects that highlight your
growth as a developer.  I can use this to extrapolate how you will grow if you continue to learn.</p>

<p>In either case, links to relevant <i>and well documented</i> github repositories will be helpful.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there are many applications, so I will likely skim your applications before reading a small subset closely.  So make it easy for me to learn something while skimming.</p>

<p>
  The Ph.D. is 4-6 years and if we will successfully work together, it is important that

  you develop your own research interests that (ideally) are also interesting to me.

<h2>My Goal</h2>

<p>
  My goal is to help my students practice and refine their abilities
  as researchers, and produce interesting research as a
  side-effect (albeit an important one).  
</p>
<p>
  The following lists the abilities that I believe are particularly valuable:
</p>

<p>
  <table class='row'>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Critical &<br/>logical thinking</td>
      <td>An important component of research is the ability to make logical arguments and back those arguments with evidence.  This will be your most important asset.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Technical knowledge</td>
      <td>
        Most computer scientists materialize their ideas through software systems 
        and use those systems to gather evidence.  Thus, the ability to quickly and effectively
        build the necessary systems will be a necessary component to your success.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Perseverance</td>
      <td>
        Unlike classes, where a few all nighters is sufficient to get by, the Ph.D.
        depends on making consistent progress.  There will be many stressful and difficult times during
        a Ph.D., such as paper rejections, researcher's block, or competition that you will need
        the willingness to work through.
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class='topic'>Creativity</td>
      <td>
        Our goal when doing research is to push the boundaries of what has been explored.  
        There is an art to refining and <a href="https://vimeo.com/85040589">following your taste</a>
        when picking a specific problem to work on.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>



<p>
  To help me identify applicants that will be a good match, it is 
  helpful for you to concretely demonstrate your <i>current</i> abilities.  
  The easiest way is to describe some past projects
  in terms of why they were interesting, your approach, the challenges and solutions.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.arnab.org">Arnab Nandi</a>
  has a particularly 
  <a href="http://arnab.org/blog/so-i-suck-24-automating-card-games-using-opencv-and-python">good example</a>
  of a write up that is above and beyond what I would expect.
</p>
<p>
  I don't expect applicants to be experts at everything, so it is important to be clear about
  your strengths and weaknesses.  For example,  I did not have 
  good writing technique when applying to graduate school and acknowledged it clearly
  in my application.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I will strive to work and generate ideas with you as a colleague.  So
  describe some cool research problems* that you would find awesome to work on!
</p>

<h2>Columbia Admissions Process</h2>

<p>
Computer Science at Columbia uses a centralized admissions process.
Prospective Ph.D students apply to the computer science department
at large, and faculty members review the applications and nomiate
applicants for admission.  For this reason, it is helpful to 
<a href="mailto:eugenewu@mit.edu">let me know</a> you have applied
if you are interested in working with me.
</p>

<p>
All applications should be submitted through <a href="https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/recruit/">the electronic system</a>
by <b>December 15</b> for the Fall semester, and <b>October 1</b> for the Spring semester.
</p>


<h2>Letters</h2>

<p>
  The best way to convince me you can do good research is to have done
  good research in the past.  For this reason, the most effective letters are those 
  from research supervisors that concretely describe your contributions to a specific project. 
</p>
<p>
  However, not every applicant has had the opportunity to perform research.  In this case,
  letters that can describe your technical contributions, and the way you approach problems
  are most useful.
</p>
<p>
  I will actively avoid reading letters that solely describe your performance in a course.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, my general order of preference of letter writers are: 
  <ol>
    <li>Research supervisor
    <li>Technical supervisor (e.g., your boss at a technical internship/job)
    <li>Project partners (e.g., a maintaner of an open source project)
    <li>Non-technical supervisor (e.g., your CTO/CEO/boss at your company/startup)
    <li>Course instructor
  </ol>
</p>

  *a research problem, at its most basic, is simply a problem that is very cool 
  for which no obvious solution exists.
